#plugin-based-system
This is a simple example of a plugin based system. Simple and easy to learn and very useful when we want to have a scalable system.
##Example
We have a system that saves person data in a file. We need also to save the person data in diferent types such as:
* Plain Text (Java toString)
* JSon
* CSV
* XML

In the future, probably we will need save it in much more formats, so the system must be prepared to be scalable.

##Entities
Firstly we need to have a perception that what entities we need to develop the solution.
Given the example we need to have some entities that will write the person data using a specific format. Those entities we call them as a plugin.
###Plugin
A plugin is a system component that has the function to write the person data in a specific format. The system can has many plugins.

###Plugin Manager
We need a entity to manage system plugins, the plugin manager do that work. The Plugin Manager has a reference for all plugins registered.

##Core System
All system uses Spring Ioc to load plugins. The Plugin Manager provide us information about all plugins. In this example all plugins are loaded by spring and they are registered on plugin manager.
In the class `App` there is an example how Plugin manager is used. You can adapt this example to a real scenario.

##Creating a new plugin
We want to create a plugin to save person data in JSon format.
### 1ยบ Step
To create a new plugin you only need create a maven project and put the below configuration on pom.xml file.

```xml

<dependencies>
  	<dependency>
			<groupId>org.rmr.spring.pbs</groupId>
			<artifactId>plugin-based-system</artifactId>
			<version>1.0.0</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
			<artifactId>gson</artifactId>
			<version>1.7.1</version>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>

```
> **Note:** We are dependent of the plugin-based-system to acces the plugin structure. The gson dependency refers to a JSon libraby that will be used to write person data in json format.

### 2ยบ Step
We need create an applicationContext.xml that will contains the plugin definition. So, the file created must be placed on folder src/main/resources.
After create file we need to define the plugin.

```xml

<bean id="pJSon" class="com.rmr.plugin.PJSon" parent="pluginBase">
		<property name="pluginName">
			<value>Person to Json</value>
		</property>
		<property name="pluginVendor">
			<value>JSON INC</value>
		</property>
		<property name="pluginVersion">
			<value>1.6.0</value>
		</property>
</bean>

```
####Spring Bean Description
* id -> Bean ID
* class -> Our class that represents the plugin.
* parent -> Define the plugin base of "SDK".
* 
####Properties escription
* pluginName -> The plugin Name
* pluginVersion -> The plugin Version
* pluginVendor -> The plugin Vendor
* 

####Plugin Class
In this case, we need to create the class `com.rmr.plugin.PJSon`. This class must extends the abstract class `PluginBase`.
In this plugin exampl, we'll use the library `gson` defined on pom.xml.
```java

package com.rmr.plugin;

import org.rmr.spring.pbs.core.plugin.definition.PluginBase;
import org.rmr.spring.pbs.core.runnable.Person;

import com.google.gson.Gson;

public class PJSon extends PluginBase {

	@Override
	public void write(Person person) {
		Gson gson = new Gson();
		String jsonString = gson.toJson(person);
		System.out.println(jsonString);

	}

}

```
> **Note:** As a proof of concept the plugin does not create a file, only writes the content to console.

##Core System


##How to run it?
There is a class `App` represents a simple test, to test the simple axample you only nedd to run that class. 

```java
package org.rmr.spring.pbs.core.runnable;

import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;
import org.rmr.spring.pbs.core.plugin.definition.PluginBase;
import org.rmr.spring.pbs.core.plugins.manager.PluginManager;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;

public class App {

	private static Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(App.class);

	/**
	 * The main method.
	 *
	 * @param args the arguments
	 */
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(
				new String[] { "classpath*:applicationContext.xml" });

		PluginManager pluginManager = (PluginManager) context
				.getBean("pluginManager");

		LOG.info(pluginManager.size() + " plugins() registered.");
		
		Person person = new Person(1, "Rui", "Rodrigues", 25,
				"Viana do Castelo", "Portugal");
		
		for (PluginBase current : pluginManager.plugins()) {
			current.write(person);
		}
	}

}

```
To inlude a new plugin you need to add the plugin's jar file to the build path.
