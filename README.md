#plugin-based-system
This is a simple example of a plugin based system. Simple and easy to learn and very useful when we want to have a scalable system.
##Example
We have a system that saves person data in a file. We need also to save the person date in diferent types such as:
* Plain Text (Java toString)
* JSon
* CSV
* XML

In the future probably we will need save it in much more format, so the system must be prepared to be scalable.

##How it works?
Fistly we need to have a perception that what entities we need to develop the solution.
## Entities
Given the example we need to have some entities that will write the person data using a specific format. Those entities we call them as a plugin.
###Plugin
A plugin is a system component that has the function to write the person data in a specific format. The system can has many plugins.

###Plugin Manager
We need a entity to manage system plugins, the plugin manager do that work.



###Creating a new plugin
We want to create a plugin to save person data in JSon format.
#### 1ยบ Step
To create a new plugin you only need create a maven project and puth the below configuration on pom.xml file.

```xml

<dependencies>
  	<dependency>
			<groupId>org.rmr.spring.pbs</groupId>
			<artifactId>plugin-based-system</artifactId>
			<version>1.0.0</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
			<artifactId>gson</artifactId>
			<version>1.7.1</version>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>

```
> **Note:** We are dependent of the plugin-based-system to acces the plugin structure. The gson dependency refers to a JSon libraby that will be used to write person data in json format.

#### 2ยบ Step
We need create an applicationContext.xml thet will contains the plugin definition.So, the file created must be placed on folder src/main/resources.
